# Auto suggest example

Auto suggest example by using the prop customElement. (As asked for in [issue #1](https://github.com/jimmybengtsson/react-native-tags-input/issues/1)
)

This feature will be implemented in a future release so only an array with search results is required as prop to display auto suggestions.

## Getting started
In the root directory of the app, run:

`$ npm install`


then:

`$ react-native run-ios` or `$ react-native run-android`
